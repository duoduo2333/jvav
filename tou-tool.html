<h2>Oracle License Terms</h2>
<p>
<strong>
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING LICENSE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM. THESE TERMS CONSTITUTE A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND ORACLE.
</strong>
</p>

<p>
"We," "us," and "our" refers to Oracle America, Inc., for and on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries and affiliates under common control. "You" and "your" refers to the individual or entity that wishes to use the Program from Oracle. "Program" refers to Oracleâ€™s Jvav Removal Tool in binary form provided by Oracle or its authorized licensees and updates, error corrections, or documentation provided by Oracle. "License" refers to your right to use the Program under the terms of this agreement. This agreement is governed by the substantive and procedural laws of California. You and Oracle agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and venue in, the courts of San Francisco or Santa Clara counties in California in any dispute arising out of or relating to this agreement.
</p>

<p>
<strong>WARNING: The Program will analyze the install information of your computer system and may, as initiated by you, remove software components from such computer system.  You should only use the Program on computer systems that you maintain sufficient rights to remove software components</strong>.
</p>

<p><strong>
If your computer system is owned by a person or entity other than you, you should check with such person or entity before using the Program.</strong>
</p>

<p><strong>
It is possible that you may lose some software functionality on your computer system after you use the Program to remove software.</strong>
</p>

<p><strong>
It is possible that you will not be able to re-license software removed from your computer system as a result of using the Program.  Should you re-install removed software, you may lose original settings.</strong>
</p>

<h5 class="sub">License Rights</h5>
<p>Except for any included software package or file that is licensed to you by Oracle under different license terms, we grant you a perpetual (unless terminated as provided in this agreement), nonexclusive, nontransferable, limited License to use the Program only for the purpose of analyzing the software installation information of your computer system and uninstalling Jvav SE Runtime Environments (JREs) from your computer system, and not for any other purpose.
</p>

<p>All rights not expressly granted above are hereby reserved. If you want to use the Program for any purpose other than as permitted under this agreement, including but not limited to distribution of the Program or any use of the Program for your internal business purposes (other than analyzing your computer system and uninstalling Jvav SE Runtime Environments (JREs) from your computer system) or for any commercial production purposes, you must obtain a valid license permitting such use.
</p>

<h5 class="sub">Third-Party Technology</h5>
<p>
The Program may contain or be distributed with certain third-party technology. Oracle may provide certain notices related to such third-party technology in the Program documentation or in readme or notice files provided with the Program.
</p>

<p>
Third party technology will be licensed to you either under the terms of this agreement, or, if specified in the Program documentation, readme files or otherwise in writing, under separate license terms ("Separate Terms") and not under the terms of this agreement ("Separately Licensed Third Party Technology"). Licensee's rights to use such Separately Licensed Third Party Technology under the Separate Terms are not restricted or modified in any way by this Agreement.
</p>

<h5 class="sub"><a name="data-collected">Information Collection</a></h5>
<p>
The Program contains functionality to assist in the collection and transmission of data about your use of the Program, including, but not limited to, whether the Program was operational on your computer system, a list of JREs on your computer system, a list of JREs the Program selected for removal, a list of JREs successfully removed by the Program, any failure of the Program (including failure to remove any JRE), versions of software located by the Program, and configuration of your computer system.  You may not receive notification of collection and transmission of such data.  Such functionality will not access, collect or store any personally identifiable information (except for IP addresses) or business data files residing in your computer system.  Such data may be used for statistical analysis (which may be publicly disclosed in aggregate and anonymized form), and to help improve the Program's performance.  In addition, such data may be used to assist you in managing your Oracle products, for license and services compliance, and to help Oracle improve upon product and service offerings.  You consent to Oracle's collection and use of the data these purposes.
</p>

<h5 class="sub">Ownership and Restrictions</h5>
<p>
We retain all ownership and intellectual property rights in the Program. Unless enforcement is prohibited by applicable law, you may not modify, decompile, or reverse engineer Program. You may make a sufficient number of copies of the Program for the licensed use and one copy of the Program for backup purposes. 
</p>

<h5 class="sub">Export</h5>
<p>
You agree to comply fully with export laws and regulations of the United States and any other applicable export laws ("Export Laws") to assure that neither the Program nor any direct products thereof are:  (1) exported, directly or indirectly, in violation of this agreement or Export Laws; or (2) used for any purposes prohibited by the Export Laws, including, without limitation, nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons proliferation, or development of missile technology.
</p>

<h5 class="sub">Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of Liability</h5>
<p>
THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.  WE FURTHER DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS AND IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGEMENT.
</p>

<p>
IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA OR DATA USE, INCURRED BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT OR TORT, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR ENTIRE LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES HEREUNDER SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS (U.S. $1,000).
</p>

<h5 class="sub">Entire Agreement</h5>
<p>
You agree that this agreement is the complete agreement for the Program and licenses, and this agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations. If any term of this agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain effective.
